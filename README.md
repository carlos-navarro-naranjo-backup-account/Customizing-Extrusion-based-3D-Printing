# Customizing-Extrusion-based-3D-Printing
In this project, my team and I designed a system to 3D print silicone rubber. The material chosen is a two-part curing system. We learned how to control the extrusion rate and were tasked to find a proper printing speed for a given extrusion rate. Two sets of experiments were conducted.
